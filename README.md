linknlog
========

Very basic passive IRC URL logger for multiple channels storing to sqlite3.

linknlog is easy to configure, just register a bot name on the IRC server, and add the few variables at the top of main.py.

This bot is not daemonized, so it's best if you use a multiplexer like tmux or screen. This bot also has no in-channel controls.
